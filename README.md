# [Fearless Draft Bingo](https://fearlessdraftbingo.vercel.app/)

A web-based bingo game for League of Legends viewers to track champion picks during drafts.

## Idea

With the introduction of Fearless Draft in major leagues, I thought it would be a fun idea to create a Bingo game to predict champion picks and track them in real time. This app allows you to set up a grid, select champions, and follow along as teams make their picks. Whether you're competing with friends or just testing your prediction skills, this adds an extra layer of excitement to the drafting experience!


## Features

- Customizable grid sizes (5x5 to 11x11)
- Champion selection with role filtering
- Random grid generation
- Persistent game state (saved between sessions)
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Bingo detection for rows, columns and diagonals

## How to Play

1. Choose Grid Size: Select a grid size that suits your needs.
2. Pick Selection Phase: Choose the phase in which you'll select your champions.
3. Fill the Grid: Either select/search for champions from the list to fill your grid or use the random grid option for automatic selection.
4. Randomize the Grid (Optional): Shuffle the grid to change the champion positions.
5. Switch to Playing Phase: Once you're ready, switch to the Playing Phase.
6. Mark Selected Champions: As champions are picked, mark them on your grid.
7. Achieve BINGO: Complete a row, column, or diagonal to get BINGO!
